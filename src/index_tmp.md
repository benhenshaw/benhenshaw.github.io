Dear reader,

Welcome to my website! I am a London-based video game and interactive art programmer. Here you will find my work and writing --- most of it on games and programming stuff. I am currently pursuing a masters degree in Playable Experience Design from Goldsmiths, University of London. Take a look at the page listing below to read some of my writing, or check out my [portfolio](portfolio.html) for some recent work.

If you want to talk about anything I have made or written, please feel free to [email me](mailto:benedicthenshaw@gmail.com). I encourage any and all questions. My CV is also available upon request.

I hope you find something of interest among these pages.
