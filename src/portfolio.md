## Screen Play
January 2019 \
Go, JavaScript \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/screenplay](https://github.com/benhenshaw/screenplay) \

A text-based (and web-based) multi-player improvisational real-time text adventure. Each player is given a character profile and a set of goals which they have to try to fulfil. The initial demo was built with a single scenario, but the project was constructed with the goal of supporting many different stories, each with its own set of characters and verbs. I used the explicit goals to incentivise role-play by rewarding players for the use of a characters *catch-phrase* or employing their speech patterns.

## Rhythm
Early--Mid 2018 \
C, SDL2 \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/rhythm](https://github.com/benhenshaw/rhythm) \

Dissertation project for BSc Games Programming at Goldsmiths, University of London. It's a simple rhythm game, implemented in C with the intent to build as many components of the software myself within the time constraints. In the end I wrote a memory allocator, software renderer, audio mixer, asset file reading and writing, and the game-play code for this project myself.
