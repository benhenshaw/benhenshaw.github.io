C \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/bootleg3d](https://github.com/benhenshaw/bootleg3d)

A software renderer for simple 3D graphics in a single file, written in C. It aims to provide a simple API, with a small and easy to modify code base.

## Breakfast
February 2019 \
C \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/breakfast](https://github.com/benhenshaw/breakfast)

Serial communication library for UNIX (macOS, Linux, BSD) and Windows. I wanted a simple cross-platform way to communicate with my Arduino (though it also works with any standard serial device), so I wrote this.

## Screen Play
January 2019 \
Go, JavaScript \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/screenplay](https://github.com/benhenshaw/screenplay) \

A text-based (and web-based) multi-player improvisational real-time text adventure game (and "engine"). Each player is given a character profile and a set of goals which they have to try to fulfil. The initial demo was built with a single scenario, but the project was constructed with the goal of supporting many different stories, each with its own set of characters and verbs. I used the explicit goals to incentivise role-play by rewarding players for the use of a character's *catch-phrase* or for employing their speech patterns.

C, WinSock, BSD Sockets \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/quick_udp](https://github.com/benhenshaw/quick_udp) \

A small and simple library that allows easy sending and receiving of UDP packets. It abstracts differences between WinSock and BSD sockets, and abstracts the socket model slightly further simplify their usage in the context of video games.

## Rhythm
Early--Mid 2018 \
C, SDL2 \
[https://github.com/benhenshaw/rhythm](https://github.com/benhenshaw/rhythm) \

Dissertation project for BSc Games Programming at Goldsmiths, University of London. It's a simple rhythm game, implemented in C with the intent to build as many components of the software myself within the time constraints. In the end I wrote a memory allocator, software renderer, audio mixer, asset file reading and writing, and the game-play code for this project myself.

Escape Room (with additional software in C) \
[See the article.](landing_party.html) \

An *escape room* built around the concept of limited communication. Players are split into two separate rooms and must use various limited communication channels to solve puzzles together. Built during my BSc in Games Programming.
