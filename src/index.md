Dear reader,

Welcome to my website! I am a London-based video game and interactive art programmer. Here you will find my work and writing --- most of it on games and programming stuff. See the [index](listing.html) for a listing of all of the pages on this site, ordered by the date they were last modified.

If you want to talk about anything I have made or written, please feel free to [email me](mailto:benedicthenshaw@gmail.com). I encourage any and all questions. My CV is also available upon request.

I hope you find something of interest among these pages.

--- Benedict Henshaw
