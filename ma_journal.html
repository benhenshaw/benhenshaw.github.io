<h1 id="week-01-labyrinth">Week 01 — Labyrinth</h1>
<p>During the past few weeks I have been working on a small game idea. It started as a demonstration of a 2.5D ray-tracing technique, in the style of Wolfenstein 3D. It runs at a low resolution, and uses very small textures.</p>

<p>The goal is very simple - find your way through a labyrinth. The twist is that players can draw on the walls, and their drawings are shared via a server, so players can see each others drawings. I intend to make the labyrinth confusing and complex, so my intention for this mechanic is to allow players to help each other asynchronously — leaving notes and markings for each other, returning to the game over time, and progressing together to move deeper into the labyrinth, and to find the exit. I chose drawing on walls over something like placing simple markers as I feel it allows for more player expression.</p>
<p>There are still some technical challenges involved in this that I have yet to solve. Most prominent is transferring the data for the wall drawings. Walls have 32x32 textures. If I were to store each pixel as one <em>bit</em>, one wall would require 128 <em>bytes</em> of storage to hold all the drawing data. If I were to limit the size of one level of the labyrinth to 16x16 tiles, then I would need a maximum of 32 Megabytes (16 x 16 x 128) to hold all of the drawing data; I would also prefer to have larger levels than this. This is too much data to be transferring often — It may take several minutes to download on slower connections. Thus I will need to construct a <em>streaming</em> technique that will load in drawing textures as needed, and storing them for later to avoid repeat downloads.</p>
<p>Given my more technical background, I am trying to force myself into situations where I do less programming and more game design. I think this project is a case of the opposite, and so I may put it on hold for a little while, and come back to it when I feel like a technical challenge.</p>

<h1 id="week-02-fortune">Week 02 — Fortune</h1>
<p>A few years ago I went to Oxford for a <em>hackathon</em>. The event was well catered, and at some point during the late evening fortune cookies were given out. My fortune read “Relax and enjoy yourself.”; something I took to heart during the event (I didn’t end up submitting anything). I’ve been carrying this little fortune with me in my wallet ever since.</p>

</figure>
<p>This little piece of paper represents many things for me about that time. I met many people that certainly changed the course of my life. For many of us, our time at university is one we will remember fondly, and I enjoy carrying something with me that reminds me so clearly; like a snapshot of that time.</p>
<p>I would like to produce an installation piece that prints tiny personalised artworks for guests to keep. Perhaps in the style of a fortune cookie, but I would like to explore this further. This could be achieved using a Thermal Printer (like those used for receipts in cash machines), and some natural language generation for the text content. Perhaps some images could be generated also.</p>
<p>In other news, I have been thoroughly enjoying Physical Computing. When I was a child, my grandfather taught me lots of things about electronics — how circuits work, how to read resistors, and plenty more. I had not used this knowledge for almost 10 years, but it has come back to me in a surprising way. My grandpa passed away this year; I would love to show him what I have been doing, and thank him for inspiring my love of technology.</p>

<h1 id="week-03-falling-blocks">Week 03 — Falling Blocks</h1>
<p>I am a big fan of falling block games, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo">Puyo Puyo</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Mario">Dr. Mario</a>. Lately, I have been playing quite a lot of Dr. Mario, which I enjoy in particular for the way that the blocks are structured, and how that affects the way they fall. The strategies one must employ to succeed in Dr. Mario have little in common with Tetris — so it feels fresh to me as a Tetris addict.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Another aspect of these games that appeals to me is that one can look at any individual frame of the game and they can know how well the player is doing with only a basic understanding of the rules of the game. How high is the highest block? The answer to that question gives an indication of how long the play session has lasted, and how ‘in trouble’ the player is. In Tetris, a player with a slightly better understanding of the strategies employed in the game might notice that a player is attempting to leave space for a long piece, in order to get a four-row combo.</p>
<p>In Dr. Mario, one needs to be aware that blocks are <em>cleared</em> when four or more colours are matched horizontally or vertically. Thus, the arrangement of colours is very important (unlike Tetris), and so the questions one can pose to understand the state of the game are different. In my experience, it is harder to quickly scan for the arrangement of colours on screen, as opposed to only the arrangement of positive and negative space that needs to be understood in Tetris, and so I find the game more difficult, as my real-time decisions feel less informed.</p>
<p>Does this property of ‘instant readability’ exist outside of puzzle games? Maybe it has more to do with whether the game has a camera that selectively shows the state of the world, or how abstract the presentation of the game is — non-puzzle games can have these properties too.</p>
<h4 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h4>
<p>Inspired by these games, I put together the framework for a falling block game. The first demo just randomly drops blocks every <em>tick</em>, and deletes any row if it is filled, like Tetris — it makes for quite a nice screen-saver!</p>

<p>If I have time next week, I will try to add some gameplay and make something more interesting with this.</p>

<li>I have enjoyed teaching programming for the last few years, but I have noticed that I remember less and less what it is like to learn for the first time — In some ways I think this will make me a less effective introductory teacher. I hope I can make up for this by planning my lessons more carefully, and taking in feedback.</li>
<li>I can’t wait for Katamari Damacy to come out on Nintendo Switch and PC later this year — it’s my favourite game of all time, but I’ve only played it emulated.</li>

<h1 id="week-04-magic-circle">Week 04 — Magic Circle</h1>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about the magic circle as it applies to many situations in life. One such application struck me as worth investigating — “Magic”. A magician uses the magic circle to their benefit in several ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, they form a strong circle with the viewers by carefully giving them pieces of information (“This is a full deck of cards, take a look!”) and on-boarding them so that each viewer is sure of their understanding of the situation, and places some trust in that understanding. This is something that video games also do when a player first starts playing — giving the player cues to reinforce their understanding of the situation (can’t walk through walls, other characters look at you as you walk passed confirming your existence to them, etc.).</p>
<p>Once this initial bond is formed, and the viewers are inside the circle, the magician will begin to perform an act. Given the set-up, viewers will have an expectation of the outcome. Their mental model of the situation will form its own prediction.</p>
<p>This is where the magician does their ‘magic’. A magician does not need to perform something truly impossible, only something that reaches outside the viewer’s mental model of the situation. In games, this could be compared to someone cheating at Monopoly by stealing extra money — but not getting caught. One player has stepped outside the magic circle, but the other players are unaware. Some video games do this with NPCs, giving them extra resources behind the scenes (such as more units in an RTS) to make them more difficult to compete against. If the other players are made aware then the circle is broken, as players will need to resolve a problem that exists outside the game rules.</p>
<p>I think there are some interesting takeaways from this for games. The way in which a magician explicitly designs the steps that they will take to form the magic circle is something games can also do to improve the experience of a player who has just started playing.</p>
