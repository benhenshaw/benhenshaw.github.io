<h2 id="screen-play">Screen Play</h2>
<p>January 2019<br />
Go, JavaScript<br />
<a href="https://github.com/benhenshaw/screenplay">https://github.com/benhenshaw/screenplay</a><br />
</p>
<p>A text-based (and web-based) multi-player improvisational real-time text adventure. Each player is given a character profile and a set of goals which they have to try to fulfil. The initial demo was built with a single scenario, but the project was constructed with the goal of supporting many different stories, each with its own set of characters and verbs. I used the explicit goals to incentivise role-play by rewarding players for the use of a character’s <em>catch-phrase</em> or for employing their speech patterns.</p>

<p>A small and simple library that allows easy sending and receiving of UDP packets. It abstracts differences between WinSock and BSD sockets, and abstracts the socket model slightly further simplify their usage in the context of video games.</p>

</p>
<p>Dissertation project for BSc Games Programming at Goldsmiths, University of London. It’s a simple rhythm game, implemented in C with the intent to build as many components of the software myself within the time constraints. In the end I wrote a memory allocator, software renderer, audio mixer, asset file reading and writing, and the game-play code for this project myself.</p>
